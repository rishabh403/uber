🚀 Developed a full-stack Uber clone using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with JWT authentication for secure user and captain logins.

📍 Integrated real-time maps & geolocation services using the Google Maps API for location suggestions, distance-time calculations, and fare estimations.

💳 Implemented a ride-booking system allowing users to request rides, captains to accept them, and OTP-based ride verification for security.

☁️ Deployed the application on Render with MongoDB Atlas as the cloud database, ensuring scalability and availability.

🎨 Built an interactive and responsive UI with React and Tailwind CSS, providing a seamless user experience across devices.
